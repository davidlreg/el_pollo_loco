        <strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br /><br /><strong>Liability for Content</strong><br /><br />
        The content of our pages has been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As service
        providers, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to the general laws under § 7 paragraph 1 DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated
        as service providers to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block
        the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. Liability in this regard is only possible from the time we become aware of a specific legal violation.
        Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will immediately remove this content.<br /><br /><strong>Liability for Links</strong><br /><br />
        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external
        contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
        violations at the time of the linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the linked pages is not reasonable
        without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will immediately remove such links.<br /><br /><strong>Copyright</strong

        beyond the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for private,
        non-commercial use. As far as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is
        marked as such. If you become aware of a copyright violation, we ask for a corresponding note. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will immediately remove such
        content.<br /><br /><strong>Data Protection</strong><br /><br />
        The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. As far as personal data (e.g., name, address, or e-mail addresses) is collected on our pages,
        this is always done, where possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent. <br />
        We point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication via e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data from access by third parties is
        not possible. <br />
        The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertisements and information materials is hereby
        expressly rejected. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example
        through spam emails.<br />
