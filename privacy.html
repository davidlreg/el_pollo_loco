      <br />
      <h3>
        General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this
        Website
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data
        on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a
        GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR are
        processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal
        data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 Para.
        1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access
        to information on your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), data
        processing is additionally based on § 25 Para. 1 TDDDG. The consent can
        be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for contract
        fulfillment or for carrying out pre-contractual measures, we process
        your data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we
        process your data, if these are necessary for fulfillment of a legal
        obligation on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing
        may also take place on the basis of our legitimate interest according to
        Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information about the relevant legal bases
        in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this
        privacy policy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        In the course of our business activities, we work with various external
        parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer of personal data
        to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external
        parties if this is necessary as part of a contract fulfillment, if we
        are legally obliged to do so (e.g. transfer of data to tax authorities),
        if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR
        in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer.
        When using data processors, we only pass on personal data of our
        customers on the basis of a valid data processing agreement. In the case
        of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit
        consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The
        legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct
        Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
      </h3>
      <p>
        IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E
        OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, FOR REASONS ARISING FROM
        YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION, TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL
        DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE
        RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS
        PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED
        PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS
        FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS,
        OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL
        CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU
        HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
        CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU
        OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE
        PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2
        GDPR).
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to
        lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the
        member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the
        place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is
        without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
        basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you
        or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request
        the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will
        only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
        right at any time to free information about your stored personal data,
        its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if
        necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this as
        well as for further questions on the topic of personal data, you can
        contact us at any time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data. You can contact us at any time for this. The right to
        restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
          usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the
          verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the
          processing of your personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
          unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead
          of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the
          exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to
          request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
          instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have filed an objection according to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a
          balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it
          has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
          right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal
          data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data –
        apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for
        the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the
        protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for
        reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member
        state.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
      <p>
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
        content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site
        operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an
        encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser
        changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock icon in your
        browser line.
      </p>
      <p>
        If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us
        cannot be read by third parties.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3>
      <p>
        We hereby object to the use of contact data published as part of the
        imprint obligation for sending unsolicited advertising and information
        materials. The site operators expressly reserve the right to take legal
        action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising
        information, such as through spam emails.

      <h2>4. Plugins and Tools</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Google Fonts</h3>
      <p>
        This site uses so-called Google Fonts for the uniform display of fonts,
        which are provided by Google. When you call up a page, your browser
        loads the required fonts into your browser cache to display texts and
        fonts correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers.
        Through this, Google obtains knowledge that via your IP address this
        website was accessed. The use of Google Fonts is based on Art. 6 Para. 1
        lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the
        uniform presentation of the typeface on his website. If appropriate
        consent has been obtained, processing is carried out exclusively on the
        basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 Para. 1 TDDDG, insofar as
        the consent covers the storage of cookies or access to information in
        the user's end device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of
        the TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your browser does not support Google Fonts, a standard font will be
        used from your computer.
